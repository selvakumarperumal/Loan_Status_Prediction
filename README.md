# Loan Status Prediction

##  Reading xlsx Data

read the data with the help of pandas analysis tool

## Univariate Analysis

Calculated numerical values for Mean, Median, Max, Min
To know skewness and Kurtosis implemented a functiom inside table to get numerical value for corresponding types

##  Bivariate Analysis

With the help **Chi-Square** did hypothesis testing between categorical variables to know the 
relationship between them, And dropped uncorrelated columns
And dropped few rown too

##  Adding Feature

I decided to use Decision  Tree and to prevent from overfitting  i added some extra columns by using existing columns,  

##  Handling Missing Values  

**KNN imputer** helped filling some missing values

## Imbalance

To overcome imbalance added duplicate data from the same sample

## Model Training
Here in model training crested Decision Tree model, because less data i have gone with Decision Tree.
And got accuracy of !00% for both training and Testing
